            <h3>Feature 1:Company has Perpetual Succession</h3>
            <p>One of the main reasons for incorporating a company is perpetual succession. After a companyâ€™s incorporation, it will continue to be in existence until its wound-up. Even in the case of death of a shareholder holding 99.99% of the shares of the company, the company will continue to be in existence.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="feature">
            <h3>Feature 2:Company is a Separate Legal Entity</h3>
            <p>A company is a separate legal entity distinct from its shareholders. Even if the total shareholding of a company is purchased by one person or a group of persons acting in concert, the company would still continue to have its separate legal entity. However, a company is not a citizen and cannot claim fundamental rights granted to citizens.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="feature">
            <h3>Feature 3:Company can be Trustee</h3>
            <p>A company can be a trustee if it has a permit from the objects clause in the Memorandum of Association of the Company.</p>
